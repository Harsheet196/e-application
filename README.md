# E-Application

# Problem Statement

The current state of Web 3 is still in its infancy and there are many challenges to be addressed for it to reach its full potential. These challenges include a lack of user-friendly interfaces, scalability issues, and a lack of adoption among mainstream users.

## Objective

To make an application or system to

- mass adoption of web3 technology
- more accessible and user-friendly for everyday users

# Our solution: E-application

College students are more eager to adapt and try new technologies than any other group and since we want to have mass adoption of web3, they are the best people to include for it. <br>
An issue that is faced by both students and faculty alike delay in Clearance of Formal applications (e.g., application for leave, etc). <br> <br>
Issues could be because of the following:

- misplacement of Applications
- unavailability of concerned person
- delays between follow ups
- or many other

our approach is to create a decentralized scalable web solution for teachers and students to upload, review and remark the formal applications.
<br>
It utilizes the benefits of blockchain to create a platform for transparent and open formal application reviewing. Accompanied with user friendly platform for users to engage with blockchain on a regular basis.
